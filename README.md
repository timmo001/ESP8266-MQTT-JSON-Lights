# ESP8266 MQTT JSON Lights [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timmo001/ESP8266-MQTT-JSON-Lights.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timmo001/ESP8266-MQTT-JSON-Lights)
ESP8266 MQTT JSON Lights. Supports brightness, effects, speed and OTA uploads. Based on https://github.com/bruhautomation/ESP-MQTT-JSON-Digital-LEDs

## Known working devices
- WS2812 5v LED Ring
- WS2811 5v LED String (Required `NEO_GRB` to be changed to `NEO_RGB` on line 56 in `main.cpp` for my set of lights)

> This is not a comprehensive list by any means. Just devices that I or others have tested are working. Feel free to try uploading to your own device and add a pull request if your device works also.

## Hardware Setup
Hardware is your choice of course. My examples however only requires a 5v power supply (which could just be USB) with high enough amperage to drive the LEDs.

### USB Neopixel WS2812 Ring/Strip Version
![USB Neopixel WS2812 Ring Version](diagrams/neopixel_ring_ws2812_5v_usb.svg)
> A 5V power supply may be required if your lights draw too much current.
> If this happens or you are planning to use more than 30 leds or so, use the below method.

### 5v PSU Neopixel WS2811 String/Strip Version
![5v PSU Neopixel WS2811 String/Strip Version](diagrams/neopixel_strip_string_ws2811_5v_psu.svg)
> The diode / zenner diode isn't required, but I added it to avoid any reverse current issues.

> You can drive over 100 LEDs without issues on this method. You may however have to add a wire from the PSU +5v to sections of the wire if you experience dimming along the string/strip.

## Software Setup
- Using Atom or VS Code, install [Platform IO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)
- Once setup, install the `esp8266` embedded platform
- Rename `src/setup-template.h` to `src/setup.h` and add your network, MQTT and lighting setup information. Take note of the `deviceName` you set. You will need this later to send MQTT messages.
- Build the project (Ctrl+Alt+B) and check for any errors

  > If the build produces an error referencing dependencies, You will need to manually install these libraries:
    - Adafruit NeoPixel
    - ArduinoJson
    - PubSubClient
    - WS2812FX
- Upload to your board of choice (Ctrl+Alt+U). This project was created specifically for the `NodeMCU` but can be configured to work with another WiFi board with some tinkering.

> The speed of the lights will be slower the higher the slider value and faster the lower the value. Treat this more as a delay slider than a speed slider.
